# Linear-Regression

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model using Python. The goal is to understand the relationship between independent variables and a continuous dependent variable through statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

The project follows a complete machine learning workflow, starting from data preprocessing and exploration to model training, evaluation, and result visualization. It is designed for learning as well as practical understanding of regression-based problems.
